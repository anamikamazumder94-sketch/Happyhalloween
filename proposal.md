# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Mario's Burger Quest

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A 2D Pygame where Mario moves to eat falling burgers while avoiding other foods that cause the player to lose.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project, Mario's Burger Quest, is a Python-based arcade game created with Pygame. The player controls Mario, who can move left and right to catch falling burgers. Each time Mario eats a burger, the score increases. However, other foods like pizza or fries will also fall, and if Mario eats them by mistake, the game ends. As time passes, the foods fall faster, making the game more challenging. The game will include collision detection, score tracking, and sound effects for eating and losing. There will also be a start screen and a game-over screen showing the player’s final score. The project demonstrates basic animation, user input handling, and game logic using loops and conditions in Python.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?


Add a start and game-over screen, background music, and increasing speed for falling foods.

Include multiple levels, sound effects for eating and losing, animations for Mario and the foods, and a high-score system.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Implement smooth character animations and improved graphics with themed backgrounds for each level.
Add new types of foods with different point values, power-ups, and a more dynamic difficulty system that adjusts to the player’s score.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline? 
Create a polished, fully playable version with menu navigation, saved high scores, detailed sprite animations, and background transitions between levels.
Include an engaging storyline with short cutscenes, customizable settings (music on/off, difficulty), and optimized performance across different devices.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
My next steps include improving my skills in Pygame for handling advanced animation, collision detection, and multiple game states such as menus and levels. I will research how to manage sprite groups, implement sound and music loops, and optimize the game’s speed. I will also learn how to create and import custom graphics and sounds. By completing these steps, I aim to develop a fully interactive and visually appealing game that demonstrates my understanding of Python programming and game design.
