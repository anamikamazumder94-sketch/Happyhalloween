Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
 
I have planned the game mechanics and storyline for Mario’s Burger Quest. I have written the basic Python code for character movement, and burger collection, and implemented the game loop, score tracking, and simple collision detection. I have also started designing the game environment using  simple images.
#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet added multiple levels  nor have I implemented power-ups, sound effects, or a start/end game menu. I also need to test and debug the code thoroughly to ensure smooth gameplay.



#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have encountered challenges with collision detection, especially when multiple objects overlap. I am also working on making the character movement smoother and more responsive, and figuring out the best way to structure the code for multiple levels without it becoming too complex.
